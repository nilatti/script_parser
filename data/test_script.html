    <h2>
      INTRODUCTORY NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of John Webster's life almost nothing is known. The dates 1580-1625 given
      for his birth and death are conjectural inferences, about which the best
      that can be said is that no known facts contradict them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first notice of Webster so far discovered shows that he was
      collaborating in the production of plays for the theatrical manager,
      Henslowe, in 1602, and of such collaboration he seems to have done a
      considerable amount. Four plays exist which he wrote alone, "The White
      Devil," "The Duchess of Malfi," "The Devil's Law-Case," and "Appius and
      Virginia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duchess of Malfi" was published in 1623, but the date of writing may
      have been as early as 1611. It is based on a story in Painter's "Palace of
      Pleasure," translated from the Italian novelist, Bandello; and it is
      entirely possible that it has a foundation in fact. In any case, it
      portrays with a terrible vividness one side of the court life of the
      Italian Renaissance; and its picture of the fierce quest of pleasure, the
      recklessness of crime, and the worldliness of the great princes of the
      Church finds only too ready corroboration in the annals of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster's tragedies come toward the close of the great series of tragedies
      of blood and revenge, in which "The Spanish Tragedy" and "Hamlet" are
      landmarks, but before decadence can fairly be said to have set in. He,
      indeed, loads his scene with horrors almost past the point which modern
      taste can bear; but the intensity of his dramatic situations, and his
      superb power of flashing in a single line a light into the recesses of the
      human heart at the crises of supreme emotion, redeems him from mere
      sensationalism, and places his best things in the first rank of dramatic
      writing.

ACT I

<pre xml:space="preserve">       SCENE I<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2232/2232-h/2232-h.htm#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1" id="linknoteref-1">[1]</a>

       [Enter] ANTONIO and DELIO

  DELIO.  You are welcome to your country, dear Antonio;
  You have been long in France, and you return
  A very formal Frenchman in your habit:
  How do you like the French court?

  ANTONIO.                          I admire it:
  In seeking to reduce both state and people
  To a fix'd order, their judicious king
  Begins at home; quits first his royal palace
  Of flattering sycophants, of dissolute
  And infamous persons,—which he sweetly terms
  His master's master-piece, the work of heaven;
  Considering duly that a prince's court
  Is like a common fountain, whence should flow
  Pure silver drops in general, but if 't chance
  Some curs'd example poison 't near the head,
  Death and diseases through the whole land spread.
  And what is 't makes this blessed government
  But a most provident council, who dare freely
  Inform him the corruption of the times?
  Though some o' the court hold it presumption
  To instruct princes what they ought to do,
  It is a noble duty to inform them
  What they ought to foresee.<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2232/2232-h/2232-h.htm#linknote-2" name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2">[2]</a>—Here comes Bosola,
  The only court-gall; yet I observe his railing
  Is not for simple love of piety:
  Indeed, he rails at those things which he wants;
  Would be as lecherous, covetous, or proud,
  Bloody, or envious, as any man,
  If he had means to be so.—Here's the cardinal.

       [Enter CARDINAL and BOSOLA]

  BOSOLA.  I do haunt you still.

  CARDINAL.  So.
